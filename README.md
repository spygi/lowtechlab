## Summary
### Basics
We learned the basics of Java and Python.

+ Basic commands
  + Conditionals: if/else if/else
  + Loops: for, while
+ Define and call methods with arguments
+ Simple types:
  + Boolean: true/True, false/False
  + Numbers: int, float
  + Strings: ""/''
    + Basic functions: find, join, replace, upper etc.
+ Complex types
  + Arrays/list
  + Map/dictionary/object
+ Object oriented programming (Java only)
  + Classes and Objects
  + Define common functionality in a parent class.
  + Extend/change parent class.
+ Run a program

We used Java 8, Python 3.7 in VSCode.

#### Major differences between Java and Python
1. Python syntax is based on spaces. In Java (and most other languages) space does not matter and syntax is based on `{}` instead.
1. Python is not so "strict" as Java. We also say Python is "dynamically typed".   
  + For example a list can contain numbers and strings: (1, 2, 'a string here') which is not possible in Java.


### Intermediate
+ Algorithms
  + Iterate, find and change element in an array or map
  + Sort an array: TODO
+ Problems
  + Program to find when a fast dog/car would catch a slower cat/bicycle.
  + Program to read Greek
+ Find documentation(Python)
+ Using Git to save/share code
  + git clone >give the repository url address and then enter
  whensome one send a code at first 
  + git pull --rebase origin master
  + save, commit and push
+ Use code from others/packages: TODO


### Next steps
+ Google/[Stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com) to answer programming questions.
+ Youtube for tutorials.
+ Online universities: [Coursera](coursera.org), [EdX](edx.org), [Udacity](udacity.com).
+ Other sites: [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Geeksforgeeks](www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
